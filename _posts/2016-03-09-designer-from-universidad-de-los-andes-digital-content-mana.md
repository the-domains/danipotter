  Designer from Universidad de los Andes.

  Digital Content Manager in “Todos por la Educación”, a non-political movement,
  and Community Gardener in World Tech Makers, a technology education platform
  for Latin America working to unleash human potential.

  Interested in technology business ventures with social impact through the
  development of VOW, a mass communication tool for non-profit entities that
  enhances their impact while monetising their social media.



  I am committed to promote the use of social media and networks to generate
  social and cultural changes, convinced that they are a tool where one can
  listen to understand and build upon conversation.
